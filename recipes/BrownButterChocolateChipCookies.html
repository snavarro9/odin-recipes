    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies are an elevated version of a classic. They have a richer flavor, texture, and taste gourmet. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups (145g) cake flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (100g) bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 cup + 2 tbsp unsalted butter, browned to make 1 cup</li>
        <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tsp  espresso powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 large egg + 1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>5 oz dark chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by browning the butter. I walk through the entire browning process here. </li>
        <li>When it;s done, pour it into a glass measuring cup. Scrape down the bottom of the pan because you don't want to miss those brown bits at the bottom.
            Make sure it measures 1 cup. If it's a little over, take some out. If it's a little under, add some water.</li>
        <li>Place it in the fridge to cool down. Don't leave it in for more than 30 minutes. It should be a liiiiittle warm to the touch but not hot.</li>
        <li>While the butter chills, chop the chocolate.</li>
        <li>Then, combine the flours, salt, and baking soda in a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the sugars, espresso powder, and cooled brown butter. It will not be smooth, but do your best to combine the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix in the vanilla, lemon juice, and eggs. Finally, slowly incorporate the dry ingredients until the dough comes together -
            careful not to over mix. Fold in the chocolate.</li>
        <li>Using a large 2 oz cookie scoop, scoop out the cookie dough onto a cookie sheet lined with wax paper to prep for the fridge.
            Recipe makes 12-13 large cookies. Refrigerate uncovered for at least 4 hours but preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Once chilled, preheat the oven to 350F and bake the cookies for 12-14 minutes. Space the cookies about 2 inches apart.
            You're looking for golden brown edges and a pale doughy center.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with some sea salt when they're fresh from the oven then transfer to a cooling rack. Doing it while they are still warm helps the salt stick.
            Careful when transferring as the cookies will still be soft.</li>
        <li>Cool completely before eating. Enjoy!</li>
