    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> Crispy chocolate chip cookies with buttery and crispy edges. The center is thin and chewy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (130g) all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (110g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp pure maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>3.5oz 85% cocoa dark chocolate bar</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium sized bowl, whisk together the flour (see notes on how to properly measure), baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the butter, sugar, and maple syrup, followed by the milk, egg yolk, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Pour in the dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula to fold the dough together.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped chocolate and fold to combine.</li>
        <li>Using a large 3-tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop the cookie dough out onto the baking sheet and space them well apart.
            I suggest baking only 3-4 cookies at a time as they spread quite a bit.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the edges are golden brown and the center looks a bit lighter than the outside.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. 
            They're turn super crisp and chewy once cooled. Enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
